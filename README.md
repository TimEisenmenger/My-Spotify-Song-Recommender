## Project Description
This poject was all about creating a song recommender based on billboards top100 charts and spotify. 
My application checks if the songinput from user is in the current top 100 charts. If yes, it gives a song recommendation out of the top100 which is similar to the song input. If no, it gives song recommendation out of a huge spotify database and also in the same style.

## Rules
Just search for your favorite song and enjoy the show!

## Workflow
1. Setting up tools i need (spofity API) 
2. Designing code structure.
3. Thinking about possible difficulties.
4. Creating the recommender
5. Testing

## Organization & Tools
1. I used webscraping to gain information about the latest music trends. 
2. I used the spotify API to create a database of songs. In addition i made use of songfeatures to devide songs into different clusters to get a more precize recommendation based on user input

My repositiory contains the following:
1. READ ME.file --> Shows you how the song recommender works.
2. gitignore.file 
3. Last and final version of my code
